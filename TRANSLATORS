Thanks to all of those who have helped translate Cnchi, both in the past and
currently. Our translations are currently maintained in Transifex; please read
doc/translation-help.txt for more details.

Below is a list of past translators before we switched to Transifex; more can
be found by looking in the GIT history.

If your language is not already in the various po/ subdirectories and you wish
it was, set up a team in Transifex for your language and we will be happy to
add your language to the mix.

Cnchi - Translating
====================

This document is here to guide you in helping translate Cnchi messages.

We are currently using www.transifex.com as the translation
platform for Cnchi. You will need to sign up for an account there
and then register with a translation team on the
www.transifex.com/projects/p/antergos/


Translating Messages
--------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Translation message files are a specially formatted text file containing the
original message and the corresponding translation. These po files can then
either be hand edited, or modified with a tool such as poedit, gtranslator or
kbabel. Using a translation tool tends to make the job easier.

Please read up on Transifex usage using the
http://help.transifex.net/[Transifex Help] if you are not familiar.

Here is an example set of commands if you have a source code checkout and are
not worried about any local translations being overwritten. The .tx/ directory
is checked into the git repository so is preconfigured with the project
resources (See `tx status` output for a quick overview).

	tx pull -f
	poedit po/<mylang>.po
	tx push -t -l <mylang>

See the <<Notes,Notes>> section for additional hints on translating.

Pre-release Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A week or two before each release, the codebase will go into a string freeze
and a message will be post on our site www.antergos.com asking for translations.

At this time, the latest `.po` language files will be made available at the
Transifex project page. Translators interested in helping are encouraged to use the
features of Transifex to let others know they are currently translating their
language.

Once a translator has completed the translation (*OR* realizes they do not have
time to finish), please upload your progress back to the Transifex site.

NOTE: Please upload your translations as soon as possible- this will give other
speakers of your language time to review your translations and update them as
necessary.

Adding a New Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making a new language is not too hard, but be sure to follow all the steps.
You will have to do the following steps in the `po/` directory,
substituting where appropriate. Run the following command:

	msginit -l <lang code> -o <lang code>.po -i cnchi.pot

Look at the current message files for more guidance if necessary. Once you
create the new language file, you may need to slightly modify the headers;
try to make them look similar to the other .po file headers. In addition, for
all new translations we would strongly recommend using UTF-8 encoding.

Notes[[Notes]]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

msgid and msgstr 'variables' can be on as many lines as necessary. Line breaks
are ignored- if you need a literal line break, use an `\n` in your string. The
following two translations are equivalent:

	msgstr "This is a test translation"

	msgstr ""
	"This is a test translation"

If you want to test the translation:

	cp <lang code>.mo /usr/share/locale/<lang code>/LC_MESSAGES/cnchi.mo
    LANG=<lang code> ./cnchi
